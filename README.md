# ⚡ VLESS over WebSocket (WS) on Google Cloud Run + CDN

This project allows you to deploy a **VLESS proxy** server over **WebSocket** using **Xray-core**, fully containerized with Docker and deployed to **Google Cloud Run**, fronted by **Google Cloud CDN**.

---

## 🌟 Features

- ✔️ VLESS over WebSocket (WS)
- ✔️ Deployed on Google Cloud Run (serverless + autoscaling)
- ✔️ Works with Google Cloud Load Balancer + CDN
- ✔️ Dockerized and easy to deploy
- ✔️ Designed for domain fronting, bypassing, FreeNet

---

## ⚠️ Important Notice

- ❌ Google Cloud IPs starting with `34.*` and `35.*` **do NOT work** reliably with V2Ray/VLESS.
- ✅ Use a **custom domain with HTTPS** via **Google Load Balancer + CDN** for proper functionality.

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

### Step 1: Build Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/vless-ws .
```

### Step 2: Push to Container Registry

```bash
docker push gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/vless-ws
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Google Cloud Run

```bash
gcloud run deploy vless-ws \
  --image gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/vless-ws \
  --platform managed \
  --region us-central1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --port 8080
```

> ☑️ Make sure to allow **unauthenticated access**.

## 🌐 Setup Google CDN + Load Balancer

1. Go to **Google Cloud Console > Network services > Load balancing**
2. Create a new **HTTP(S) Load Balancer**
3. Add your **Cloud Run service** as a backend
4. **Enable CDN** on the backend
5. Attach a **custom domain** and **SSL certificate**

> 🔒 HTTPS is handled by Google; no need to configure TLS in Xray.
